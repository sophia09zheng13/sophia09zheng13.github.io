      <h2>Photo</h2>
      <p>Here's an image of a cozy bookstore!</p>
      <img src="images/bookstore.jpg" alt="A photo representing Sophia's ideal booknook" class="main-image">
      <p>My ideal book nook is a quiet little pocket of the world where time 
        loosens its grip—a corner tucked near a window, warmed by late-afternoon 
        light and softened by sheer curtains that move with the breeze.
         A low, overstuffed chair sits there like it’s been waiting just for me, layered with mismatched pillows 
         and a blanket that smells faintly of laundry soap and coffee. Books are stacked everywhere, not perfectly shelved, 
         but lived-in—some with dog-eared pages, others half-finished and face-down, as if pausing mid-thought. There’s a small side table 
         just big enough for a mug of tea and a pencil for underlining sentences that feel like secrets. The space feels calm, 
         a place where I can disappear into stories. Since I have yet to have this booknook, this is like a digital reimagining of what 
        that space would look like. </p>
      <p>Reading has always been special to me because it feels less like an activity and more like a place I can go when I need grounding, 
        curiosity, or quiet company. It’s where I learned how to sit with my own thoughts, how to understand people whose lives look nothing like mine,
         and how to name feelings I didn’t yet have words for. Books let me slow down in a world that constantly asks me to move faster. They give me 
         permission to pause, to wonder, to feel deeply without having to perform or explain myself. Whether I’m reading to escape, to learn, or simply 
         to feel less alone, there’s something deeply comforting in the act itself:
         turning pages, rereading lines that resonate, and realizing that someone, somewhere, once felt the same way.</p>
      <p>Some of my favorite bookstores are stitched together by memory as much as by geography, each one marking a different version of me. 
        Shakespeare and Company in Paris feels almost mythic:creaky floors, handwritten notes, and the sense that if you linger long enough, 
        you’ll become part of a larger literary lineage. The Foreign Language Bookstore in Shanghai is quieter but just as meaningful to me, a refuge where 
        languages and cultures overlap. Half Price Books in Bellevue Washington carries a different kind of joy: 
        shelves packed with possibility, the thrill of finding a book you didn’t know you needed, already worn and loved by someone else. 
        And then there are the little free libraries scattered across the country, unassuming boxes on street corners,
         full of trust and generosity—along with countless bookstores from memory whose names I’ve forgotten but whose feeling I haven’t.</p>
